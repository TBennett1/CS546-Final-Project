                <p>Eight months after the events of 2016's Doom, Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out
                    60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of
                    humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed
                    to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having
                    previously been betrayed and teleported away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress
                    controlled by the AI VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox,
                    Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice
                    mankind.</p>

                <p>New Horizons sees the player assuming the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted
                    island after purchasing a deserted island package from Tom Nook, a tanuki character who has appeared
                    in every entry in the Animal Crossing series. Taking place in real-time, the player can explore the
                    island in a nonlinear fashion, gathering and crafting items, catching insects and fish, and
                    developing the island into a community of anthropomorphic animals.</p>

                <p>Set in the late 1500s, most of Nioh 2 storyline chapters are prequel to Nioh, while the end chapters
                    of the story take place after the first game’s last storyline after the Battle at Osaka. Players
                    take the role of a character nicknamed Hide (秀, Hide), a half-yōkai referred to as a "Shiftling"
                    whose journey through the Sengoku Era begins when they befriend Kinoshita Tōkichirō, a merchant
                    seeking to make his mark in history by selling Amrita, and Mumyo, a demon hunter of the Sohaya
                    group. At the same time, the party is also accosted by Kashin Koji (果心 居士), a mysterious entity
                    involved in Hide's past who obstructs them at every opportunity.</p>
